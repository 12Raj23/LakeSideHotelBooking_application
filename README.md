## Technologies Used

### Backend (Java, Spring Boot)
- **Spring Web**: Provides RESTful web services
- **Spring MVC**: Manages application logic and routes requests
- **Spring Security**: Handles authentication and authorization
- **Spring JPA**: Simplifies database interactions
- **MySQL**: Relational database management
- **Java**: Programming language

### Frontend (JavaScript, React)
- **React**: Library for building interactive user interfaces
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive and modern UI

## Architecture

The Lakeside Hotel Booking application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

1. **Model**: Manages data entities and database interactions.
2. **View**: React-based UI rendering booking data and actions.
3. **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and delegates to the Service layer.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple packages:

### Backend (Spring Boot)

- **Controller**: Contains classes that handle HTTP requests and map to appropriate service methods. Ex: `BookingController`, `UserController`
- **Service**: Holds the business logic of the application. Ex: `BookingService`, `UserService`
- **Repository**: Interfaces for data access, extending Spring JPA's `CrudRepository`. Ex: `BookingRepository`, `UserRepository`
- **Model**: Entity classes representing database tables. Ex: `Booking`, `Room`, `User`
- **Config**: Contains security configurations and other necessary configurations. Ex: `WebSecurityConfig`

### Frontend (React)

- **Components**: Reusable UI components. Ex: `BookingForm`, `BookingList`, `BookingDetails`
- **Services**: API calls for accessing backend endpoints. Ex: `bookingService.js`
- **Assets**: Static files and Bootstrap styling

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or later
- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **MySQL** database
- **Postman** for API testing


    ```


### UI Components

The application uses **Bootstrap** for styling, ensuring responsiveness and a polished appearance.
